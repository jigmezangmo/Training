# Introduction to Programming

## Evolution of Computing Devices

* 1940 - * ENIAC * (size of 3-4 double decker buses)
* 1947 - * Transistors * (size of the vaccum tubes and consumed less power)
* 1958 - * Integrated Circuits * (Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce)
* 1968 - * Intel Electronics * (Robert Noyce)

## Binary Number System

* Base 2 number System
* Computer understand only 0 and 1
* 0 and 1 are also called bit ("Binary Digit")
* 8 bit is 1byte
* A byte can represent 256 values
* 2^ * place multiplier

## Memory Classification

* Registers
* Cache
* Primary Memory (RAM)
* Secondary Memory (Hard Disks etc.)

## High Level Language

* Compiler -> Machine specific assembler -> Machine language (Fortran, Algol in 1950's and 60's)
* Translate to machine code using "Assembler"

## Stack & Heap

* Stack and Heap Memory Space used by programs
* Allocated on RAM
* Stack us used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation
